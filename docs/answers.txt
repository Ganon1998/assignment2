8.) Inheritance is when classes or objects inherit member functions and member variables from its parent. Polymorphisms is the ability for a class to have a function that overrides its parent function. Encapsulation is a class's ability to contain it's members with identifiers like public, private, and protected.

9.) The major difference between the workflows is that Integration Manager don't need to report directly to a manager to push/pull. They just have to email the manager. The Dictator and Lieutenant requires collaborators to report to the lieutenant and then report to a dictator to push/pull.

10.) The dictator and lieutenant workflow is more appropriate for a large team because there's a chain of command to follow, and every push/pull goes through a process of approval. The centralized workflow allows pushing/pulling at anytime.
